        "I pondered the black box of metal and silicon that could bridge worlds and defeat the greatest human chess mind of our time; it truly was indistinguishable from magic. At thirteen, I had just finished building my own computer. As I pressed my finger to the power button, the computer came to life with a soft hum, and a mixture of pride and blue LEDs lit up my face. I had solved one piece of the mystery, but I knew a whole world lay ahead of me. As I learned and matured over the years, I grew ever more fascinated with the vast potential for computing technologies to solve the pressing problems we face. I have also come to realize that, as important as technical abilities are, business and management skills are essential in driving teams and turning concepts into reality. During my undergraduate career at Cornell, I’ve programmed video games, built a robot that tracks faces and takes pictures, predicted movie ratings with regression models, created award winning projects at hackathons, and worked for multi-billion dollar companies. If I were thrown into the world now, I have no doubt I could do well for myself. However, my vision of my future does not revolve around me. I want to leverage my skills and resources to make a difference in the lives of others, to make the seemingly impossible possible for those in need, and to build products that make the world a better and more beautiful place. To truly realize my goals as an engineer and entrepreneur, I recognize that I have a lot to learn in both technology and product management. Pursuing a Masters of Engineering in computer science at Cornell Tech is an invaluable step to advance my technical and managerial abilities to the capacity I want, and to make crucial connections with leaders in the field.

        My background in computer science has been full of diverse and exciting projects, versing me well in software development, and refining my ability to lead and collaborate on a team. Through my coursework, internships, and independent development, I have become proficient in software architecture, algorithms, user experience, the web, and team and project dynamics. Some key classes I have taken include Analysis of Algorithms (CS 4820) with Dexter Kozen, Operating Systems (CS 4410) with Emin Gun Sirer, Artificial Intelligence (CS 4700) with Bart Selman, Machine Learning (CS 4780) with Thorsten Joachims, and Entrepreneurship for Engineers (MAE 4610) with John Callister.

        Moving forward I am particularly interested in pursuing artificial intelligence and machine learning, with the personal belief that these areas have the greatest potentials for growth and application as we tackle increasingly complex problems in the future. Today, even the simplest of organisms boast intuition and adaptive learning processes that modern machines envy, but we are inevitably reaching a point where this divide will dissolve. Coupled with the push for ubiquitous computing, the potential applications for intelligent systems are breathtaking: predictive diagnosis and risk assessment for healthcare, fully autonomous farming, energy optimization, emergency response systems, smart homes, and self-driving cars, the latter of which is already becoming a reality. As we enter this age, I want to be at the forefront of the push, working with the best to create disruptive and practical technology for mankind. I am currently pursuing a vector in AI for my undergraduate degree, and have experience in many relevant areas, including natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. An example of my past work in AI is a project that used a genetic algorithm to optimize the placement of defense assets in a virtual 2D world. Our goal was to improve the survivability of a simulated colony under attack. It was incredible to see the systems I built come alive, learning and adapting to accomplish complex tasks. In the future, I want to combine this passion with my entrepreneurial ambition to create cutting edge, relevant products.

        In both class projects and outside work, I have taken numerous lead development roles in which I spearheaded the design of a product and organized a team. For my game development class, I was elected lead developer in a cross-disciplinary group of six. In this role I made pivotal technical decisions, organized the development timeline, and delegated tasks. The game was successful (and fun!), however a couple of unresponsive team members hindered our ability to perform consistently. To address this problem, I reached out to those individuals and gave them direction and encouragement where necessary. I ensured that critical tasks were ultimately completed by maintaining healthy pressure on the team and by taking on extra work as an example to the others. Similarly, this past summer, I worked on a small team for a hackathon in which we architected a mobile web app to split bills and pay friends. My role in rallying the team and designing the database and UX was crucial in turning our idea into a tangible product. Our project won an award for “Most likely to make money” and a cash prize. I feel that these experiences in practical leadership have dramatically improved my ability to drive a superior team.

        If I receive a graduate education in computer science, I will use my degree, knowledge, and connections to lead the design and execution of projects critically relevant to modern problems. Ultimately, I hope to apply my skills and passion for intelligent systems to start my own company to tackle challenging problems in areas such as health, sustainability, and automation. I will use my business knowledge to manage the highest quality products and to capitalize on market opportunities and technological innovations. I believe a graduate education in computer science at Cornell Tech would give me the necessary background to achieve these goals.

        The program at Cornell NYC Tech aligns perfectly with my goals to powerfully impact the tech world as a software engineer and entrepreneur. Its dual focus on the technical and business aspects of computer science offers exactly what I am looking for: a unique blend of academics and hands on insight into the evolving digital economy. The mentorship and open forum of ideas afforded by the studio culture and practicums would develop my ability to think with an open-minded entrepreneurial perspective. The opportunity to meet some of the most prominent entrepreneurs, VCs, and leaders in the tech field is an ideal way to get immersed in the community. I would be thrilled to bounce ideas back and forth with Alfred Spector and engage in conversations led by Yancy Strickler. Likewise, the project-based style of education embodied by the company and startup projects would hone my ability to apply knowledge to real world problems and to orchestrate successful ventures on a team. I want to spend my life building innovative and practical things, and there is no better way to seed my career than by working integrally in New York’s booming startup scene. The continuation of startup projects like Doctible after graduation is evidence of how rewarding the program is. The coursework also comprises a solid academic core; Modern Analytics, Building Startup Systems, and Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing are of particular interest to me. Finally, I am eager to study under Cornell Tech’s renowned faculty; I would like to learn more about Serge Belongie’s work with computer vision in machine learning together with his background in startups. In summary, the graduate computer science program at Cornell NYC Tech is a phenomenal fit for my background and interests and, if accepted, I envision myself as a spirited and influential member of its community on a course to lead the next generation of technology."
